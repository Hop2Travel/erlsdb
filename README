rake --tasks : to know all tasks

You'll need a configuration in which you'll have to put things specific to your installation.
A template of file is generated the first time you launch 'rake'

Here is some useful tasks:
rake erlang:modules: Compile all erlang source files (test included)
rake erlang:releases: Build a tarball for each rel file found in the directory tree
rake erlang:tests[name]: Run the eunit test for the application "name". If no name is given, 
     all applications are tested. If a file test.desc is find in the "app_name/test" directory, eunit will
     use it as eunit test description.
rake erlang:edoc[name]: Build the document for an application or all if 'name' is omitted
rake otp:new_application[name]: Create a new application squeleton
rake otp:start_local[name]: Start a release in the developper environment

rake otp:initial_targer[name,version]: Create a tarball with a 'ready' to deploy
     an erlang system running the release. To use the system, you have to provide
     2 startup files in a directory named 'release_config'. Look at the sample in the
     application sample_rake.
